# Acknowledgements
CMOD is built upon the [Vue framework](vuejs.org) and uses [Vuex](vuex.vuejs.org) for state management. In addition CMOD makes use of [vue-class-component](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component) and [vue-property-decorator](https://github.com/kaorun343/vue-property-decorator). For the modeller CMOD uses [vue-multipane](https://github.com/yansern/vue-multipane) for the layout.
