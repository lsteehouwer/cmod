# CMOD 
CMOD is an alternative front-end for [CoRA](https://github.com/ArchitectureMining/CoRA), the coverability and reachability graph assistant.

# Acknowledgements
CMOD is built upon the [Vue framework](https://vuejs.org) and uses [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org) for state management. In addition, CMOD makes use of [vue-class-component](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component), [vue-property-decorator](https://github.com/kaorun343/vue-property-decorator), and [vuex-module-decorators](https://github.com/championswimmer/vuex-module-decorators). For the modeller CMOD uses [vue-multipane](https://github.com/yansern/vue-multipane) for the layout.
