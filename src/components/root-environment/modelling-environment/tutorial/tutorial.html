        <p>On the left side of the screen you can find an image of the Petri net you selected. On the right you can find the modeller, wherein you can model a coverability graph for the Petri net.</p>
        <p>You can do almost anything just by using the mouse. By left-clicking on an element of the graph (states and edges) you can select an element. Right-clicking on the modeller will present you a context menu giving you context-dependent options.</p>
        <p>To add a state to the graph, press <span class="key">a</span>. You can add an edge between two states by selecting a state, holding the <span class="key">Ctrl</span> button and then selecting another state.</p>
        <p>To mark a state as the initial state, select the state and press <span class="key">i</span>. To remove the initial state, select nothing and press <span class="key">i</span> again.</p>
        <p>To edit an element of the graph, select the element you want to edit and press <span class="key">e</span>.</p>
        <p>You can undo and redo changes using <span class="key">Ctrl+z</span> and <span class="key">Ctrl-y</span>. Alternatively, so you can use <span class="key">Ctrl+Shift+z</span> to undo changes.</p>
